Devel-SlowBless version 0.04
============================

This module provides functions to introspect the current value of the
PL_sub_generation and the PL_amagic_generation internal perl variables,
as well as a perl debugger implementation that will print out a stack
trace whenever either of these variables changes.

Whenever either of these variables changes, the bless() function slows
down as perl examines the entire class heirarchy recomputing the overloads
that are normally cached in the stash.  The penalty is paid just once for
each class, but if these variables are changing frequently, and your program
has deep class hierarchies with overloading, performance can suffer badly.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
