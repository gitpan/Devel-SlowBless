=head1 NAME

Devel::SlowBless - Perl extension for identifying code that causes bless
into overloaded classes to be slow.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  perl -d:SlowBless
  ... # initialization code that is expected to change PL_sub_generation
  Devel::SlowBless::start_warning();
  ... # a stack backtrace will be output whenever PL_sub_generation or
      # PL_amagic_generation changes
  Devel::SlowBless::stop_warning(); # what it says. optional, obviously

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides functions to introspect the current value of the
PL_sub_generation and the PL_amagic_generation internal perl variables,
as well as a perl debugger implementation that will print out a stack
trace whenever either of these variables changes.

Whenever either of these variables changes, the bless() function slows
down as perl examines the entire class hierarchy recomputing the overloads
that are normally cached in the stash.  The penalty is paid just once for
each class, but if these variables are changing frequently, and your program
has deep class hierarchies with overloading, performance can suffer badly.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.

  sub_gen
  amg_gen
